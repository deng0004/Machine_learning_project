# Machine_learning_and_neural_network_project

## This is a project about collecting data in 4 different movement to perform machine learning and neural network. 

## Explanation of collected data (the data will be used for machine learning and neural network)
I chose running, walking, jumping and bend_knee during the moment of collecting my body data. The data are collected individually by its group. Also, there is another data was collected by combining all movement of myself. 

### Explanation of machine learning model
I chose KNeighborsClassifier, because this machine learning is classification model. Also, KNN has the property of find how spread are the data surrounding by the K-value. Besides, using grid search can let me to pick my k-value, weight and display the accuracy. 

## Results of machine learning. 
In the end, the value of count, mean, std, min, 25%, 50%, 75% and max will be display in a table format. Also, finding the correlation  
Here is an example of the testing data result
